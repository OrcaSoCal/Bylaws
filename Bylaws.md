# ORCA Bylaws

**OCEAN RACING CATAMARAN ASSOCIATION (ORCA), INCORPORATED**

BYLAWS –
*Approved by the ORCA Board of Directors (BoD) on January 10, 2023..*

---

## 1.0 ORCA OBJECTIVES

------------------To foster safe and comfortable ocean racing and cruising activities aboard
cruising/racing multihulls (both catamaran and trimaran); to improve the understanding and appreciation of these boats by the yachting world; to gain greater knowledge of the design requirements of these boats, and to more successfully relate these requirements to performance on handicap.
## 2.0 ORCA HISTORY

---------------The Ocean Racing Catamaran Association was founded on June 19, 1965 in
Los Angeles, California. Its initial membership was derived from the membership of the Pacific Catamaran Association as the result of the need, on the part of the cruising-type ocean racing catamaran owners, who had previously founded PCA, to gain freedom to carry out the objectives stated above. ORCA became a California Domestic Stock Corporation on March 31, 1972, but has issued no stock.
## 3.0 ORCA MEMBERSHIP

------------------3.1 Membership is open to boat owners and non owning interested persons.
Voting rights are reserved for owners; each boat is entitled to one vote. If a boat has multiple owners (a partnership) each part-owner (or his written proxy) may cast only his share of the associated boat's vote on any matter or in any election, or the managing owner may cast the boat's entire vote.
## 3.2 Non-voting (supporting) memberships are available to multihull enthusiasts

or to the owners of non-qualified boats who wish to support the association's program.
## 3.3 The membership fee entitles the associated boat to a rating.

## 3.4 To qualify for a full membership, the associated boat must be a multihull

sailboat, meeting the requirements of this document. Approval will be decided at the discretion of the Board. The underlying principle is safety under racing, cruising, or survival conditions at sea.

ORCA Bylaws 1-15-23.doc

## 3.5 A boat and her owner shall comply with recognized principles of

sportsmanship and fair play. Members may, in extreme circumstances, be temporarily suspended or permanently banned from ORCA races, for flagrant rule violations or unsportsmanlike conduct.
## 3.6 A completed written application must be received by the Secretary at least 2

weeks before any race that the applicant wishes to participate in. The application will be acknowledged by email, fax or US mail. The BoD can make an exception if 4 board members AND the rating chairman concur.
## 4.0 ORCA GOVERNMENT

-------------------

## 4.1 ORCA is governed by a Board of Directors (BoD) presided over by the

President of ORCA. The State of California requires that our Corporation have a Secretary and a Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The same person may hold both offices. Officers may also be directors.
## 4.2 The BoD sets all policies, modifies Bylaws, approves membership

applicants and their associated multihull and creates the rating structure of the fleet. All BoD decisions must be agreed to by four (4) Board members. A two-thirds (2/3) majority of the Association's voting membership can overturn a BoD decision at a Special Election called for that purpose.
## 4.3 BoD members must be voting members and must have been ORCA voting

members for at least one (1) year.
## 4.4 BoD members are elected annually in the 4th quarter annual member

meeting, and take office in January. There must be at least four (4) board meetings per annum, one in every quarter. The President is responsible for appointing the ORCA officers and may appoint additional Directors as needed, subject to BoD approval.
## 4.5 The Minutes of all BoD meetings, including all decisions, will be published

with the names of Directors voting "nay" on any matter that is Moved, Seconded and Passed. If there is general agreement; "There were no nays" is a suitable report on the matter.

## 5.0 CLASSIFICATION OF BOATS AND RACES

------------------------------------------------5.1 Guiding Principles
ORCA class boats race long distances without external assistance and need to be self-sufficient. ORCA boats keep their crew on-board and avoid capsize at all cost, and are also prepared to survive these events. ORCA boats are prepared to deal with high winds, large seas, bad weather, crew injury, and are capable of sailing at night. ORCA boats can reach safe harbor, if necessary, without outside assistance. In case of emergency, ORCA boats are prepared to call and signal for assistance. While boat and crew safety are the responsibility of a boat's skipper, the ORCA class safety gear requirements are in place to encourage safe racing. Gear requirements remove the incentive for a skipper to carry less safety gear in order to gain racing advantage by saving weight, and also to provide a more stable basis for performance handicapping.
## 5.2 ORCA races are divided into three categories by the BoD; Day race,

Coastal race, and Ocean race. These categories are noted on the ORCA race calendar. A Day race is the shortest and is not expected to involve night racing. A Coastal race is longer and may involve night racing. An Ocean race is the longest distance and may span multiple days. To be eligible for a specific race category, a boat must meet the size, design, construction, and gear requirements appropriate to that class of race and be approved by the BoD for that category of race. Day races require meeting section 6. Coastal races require meeting sections 6 and 7. Ocean races require meeting sections 6, 7, and 8. These sections have matching paragraph numbers. For example, a paragraph 7.12 will supersede or modify paragraph 6.12, as noted. Examples of Coastal Races are: Newport Beach to Ensenada, Santa Barbara to King Harbor, Catalina Island Series races, Hardway race (when the Santa Cruz Island option is chosen), Marina Del Rey to San Diego, and the Coastal Race from San Francisco. The Transpac is an example of an Ocean Race.
## 5.3 ORCA eligibility.

Conformance with the following sections does not guarantee eligibility for any specific category of ORCA race. A boat may need to demonstrate seaworthiness through a qualifying sail with one of the Directors on board, or by sailing in a minimum of three separate ORCA Day races, at least one in moderate or heavier weather conditions. It is the responsibility of the owner to arrange qualifying sails with individual Board members. The Board may, at its discretion, approve a boat of demonstrated seaworthiness, for the category of race they deem appropriate. A boat’s BoD approved highest category of race eligibility will be listed on the membership/boat roster. The BoD will inform an applicant when a rating is requested or a classification (Day, Coastal, Ocean) is changed, whether an inspection and/or qualifying

ORCA Bylaws 1-15-23.doc

sail will be required. The BoD may also revoke a boat’s approval for ORCA membership. 5.3.1 Capsize review Any capsize of an ORCA boat, anywhere, subjects that boat to a mandatory BoD review before being allowed to race as an ORCA boat again. The ORCA BoD will review the details of the capsize and assign responsibility by percentage in three primary areas; crew error, boat design, and unavoidable happenstance. In the event of a majority "crew error" capsize; on the first capsize the skipper will receive a warning and BoD recommendations for future capsize avoidance, a 1 year suspension from ORCA racing on the 2nd capsize, and BoD determined harsher penalties on the 3rd, up to and including a possible ORCA lifetime ban. In the event of a majority boat design responsibility, the BoD may consider rating that boat design as inappropriate for ORCA racing, or choose to label it an Extreme boat (see 5.3.2). The BoD may take other actions it deems appropriate, depending on the specific causes of a capsize. The goal in all cases is to reduce the possibility of future capsizes. 5.3.2 Extreme boats When a specific boat, or model of boat, demonstrates a higher than normal level of local capsizes, the BoD may choose to flag it as an “Extreme” boat. Extreme boats must carry either an EPIRB or a Satellite phone when participating in Coastal races. The hosting yacht club of a specific race, must approve the participation of Extreme boats.
## 5.4 An owner wishing to qualify a boat for eligibility for a specific class of ORCA

races should submit a request to the BoD beforehand. This request should include a written description of the boat and any intended modifications, as well as the desired class of race eligibility. The BoD will review the proposal and rule whether or not the boat and its proposed modifications will be acceptable.
## 5.5 Inspection:

Equipment may be inspected at the BoD’s discretion by any BoD member, or designated inspector, at any time in the 6 hours preceding or following a race. A BoD member, or designated inspector, will identify himself and his intention to inspect, to the boat owner. Failure to allow pre-race inspection can result in immediate disqualification from the race and/or suspension by ORCA. Failure to carry any of the required gear can result in immediate disqualification and/or suspension. Allowances will be made for equipment failure while a race is underway.

ORCA Bylaws 1-15-23.doc

## 5.6 The requirements in this document represent easily observed minimum

requirements for participation in ORCA events. No claim is made or implied that observance of these requirements will prevent injury, death, or loss of property. ORCA, its officers, and directors do not certify the suitability of any vessel for participation in any ORCA event. No analysis is made of quality of design, construction, or maintenance. The safety of a vessel and her crew is the sole responsibility of the owner, or owner’s representative, who must do his/her best to ensure that the vessel is fully found, thoroughly seaworthy and manned by experienced crew who have undergone appropriate training and are physically fit to face bad weather. He must be satisfied with the soundness of hull, spars, rigging, sails and all gear. He must ensure that all safety equipment is properly maintained and stowed and that the crew knows where it is kept and how it is used. Neither the establishment of these requirements, their use by race organizers, nor the inspection of a vessel under these requirements in any way limits or reduces the complete and unlimited responsibility of the owner or owner’s representative.
## 5.7 All boats must meet USCG requirements. No ORCA requirement is

intended to reduce or eliminate a USCG requirement. Should an ORCA requirement be less than a USCG requirement, the USCG requirements are to be followed.

## 6.0 RACING REQUIREMENTS- ALL BOATS, ALL RACES

--------------------------------------------------------6.1 Minimum twenty (20) feet length of waterline (LWL) on hull, excluding
rudders, and rudder housings.
## 6.2 Self-bailing cockpit. (If companionway access is below the level of the main

deck, suitable door slides or other comparable enclosures must be on board, bringing the height of such access up to the level of the main deck).
## 6.3 Lifelines, Pulpits, Nets, Jackstays/Jacklines/Harnesses

6.3.1 Crewmembers shall be protected from falling overboard from all areas of the boat where they can reasonably be expected to be in the normal course of their duties. These areas of the platform of the boat shall be defined as Working Deck Areas and shall be composed of solid decking or synthetic fiber webbing or netting with openings no larger than four (4) inches square. All decking or webbing/netting shall be capable of supporting a minimum of four (4) 160-pound crewmembers in close proximity. 6.3.2 The perimeter of each Working Deck Area shall be bounded by Pulpits, Lifelines or Safety nets or, alternatively, a system of Pulpits, Safety Nets and permanently mounted Jackstays to which can be clipped one or more moveable Jacklines each of which is attached to a wearable personal Harness (Jackline/Harness Assembly). 6.3.2.1 Lifelines: Lifelines shall be fabricated from stainless steel wire or from synthetic line with the equivalent strength of a 1/8-inch 7x19 coated stainless steel wire. Lifelines shall be supported by sturdily attached stanchions, 24 inches high above underlying solid decks (18 inches high on boats less than 31 feet LOA) no more than 7 feet apart (except in the case of aka-to-main-hull connections on a trimaran, the spans of which can exceed 7 feet). An intermediate lifeline is desired but not required. Lifeline stanchions shall be capable of withstanding a sideways pull of 200 lbs at the top of the stanchion with lifelines in place. Instead of a stanchioned Lifeline across the forward beam on a catamaran, a headstay bridle will suffice. A tiller cross bar is acceptable as a rear lifeline if it will withstand a 200 lb. lateral pull.

ORCA Bylaws 1-15-23.doc

Lifelines may extend downward to deck-level attachments at the bow and/or stern provided Pulpit and Safety Net rules in those areas are also met. 6.3.2.2 Pulpits: Protection for crewmembers by a Pulpit at minimum Lifeline height shall be provided at the bow area on the main hull of a trimaran. 6.3.2.3 Safety Nets: Working Deck Areas not protected by Lifelines (e. g. , areas forward of the forward aka and aft of the aft aka on a trimaran) shall be protected by Safety Nets. These shall be fabricated of line capable of supporting a falling 200pound person and have no openings larger than 6-inches square. Safety Nets shall extend horizontally a minimum of three (3) feet from adjacent Working Deck Areas they protect. 6.3.2.4 Jackstays, Jacklines, and Harnesses: If the Lifeline option is not employed, each crewmember shall have a readily available Harness Assembly aboard and be able to share in the use of a permanently affixed Jackstay(s) system appropriate to the platform and on-deck structures of the boat. Pulpit and Safety Net requirements outlined above will also be in force. 6.3.3 Bowsprit Tack-point Controls: On boats with Bowsprits, control of the movable tack points of roller-furling headsails or gennakers must take place on an adjacent protected Working Deck Area: crewmembers shall not be required to work any tack device that is more than one arm's length from a protected Working Deck Area.

speed equal to the square root of her waterline, for a distance of 15 nautical miles in flat water without a headwind.
## 6.12 Fuel Storage: Fuel for a minimum of four (4) hours of cruising required.

## 6.13 Ground Tackle: Minimum of one functional anchor required of appropriate

size and length for boat size. Minimum 15’ chain and 100’ line.
## 6.14 Minimum Number of Crew:

The minimum number of crew refers to able-bodied working crewmembers. Small children and non-sailing guests do not count as crew. Qualifying crewmembers shall be over 16 years of age, or weigh over 150 pounds, or have demonstrable or documentable sailing expertise.
| BOAT LWL, FEET | MINIMUM QUALIFIED CREW |
|----------------|------------------------|
20. 0- 30.00

49.1 or larger

2 3 4

The one exception to this minimum number of crew rule is when the race organizer specifies the number of crew, as in the Crew-of-2 Around Catalina race. ORCA ratings are calculated for the normal number of crew racing (the rated number of crew). Boats may occasionally sail with one less then their rated number of crew, but not with less than their minimum number of crew. Ratings will not be adjusted for sailing with one less than the rated number of crew, or for sailing with more than the rated number of crew, in any specific race.

ORCA Bylaws 1-15-23.doc

## 9.0 HANDICAPPING AND CONFIGURATION CONTROL

-----------------------------------------9.1 HANDICAPPING
ORCA races are won on Corrected Time order of finish. There are two rating systems in use for these purposes, depending on the length and character of the race. Short day sails employ a Time Corrected Factor (TCF) such that:
**Corrected Time = Elapsed Time x TCF**

Which is called a "Time-on-Time" system, whereas longer, overnight races during which diurnal wind effects usually are encountered, employ a Performance Handicap (PHRF) such that:
**Corrected Time = Elapsed Time – ((PHRF x Distance of Race) / 3600)**

Which is called a "Time-on-Distance" system. Experience has shown that the former is best when all boats are sailing in the same wind whereas the latter is best when the boats, strung out down the race course, encounter different winds along the course. (Elapsed Time and Corrected Time are in decimal hours, PHRF is in seconds, Distance of Race is in nautical miles) Each ORCA yacht is assigned both of these ratings by the ORCA Board, based on the ORCA rating methodology. Initially, for a new boat, the ratings are determined from measurements of a set of boat parameters relevant to boat speed, entered into the ORCA formulas. These parameters are summarized in 9.2.1 under the heading "Controlled Parameters". After racing experience with the boat has been gained, these initial ratings are slowly altered to better account for the boat's actual performance as opposed to its potential performance. Thus, a Measurement Rule gives way to a Performance Handicap wherein all effects, including crew skill and long-term tactics they employ, are taken into account. The achieved performance in a latest race is lightly weighted and combined with a heavier-weighted rating derived from all previous races to produce the slowly changing new rating as a function of performance. The implication is clear: ratings get changed only by participation in these events.
## 9.2 CONFIGURATION CONTROL

The continued success of both ratings introduced in 9.1 is dependent on maintaining Configuration Control over the actual configurations of all boats as opposed to their listed configurations. At present, ORCA uses the honor system to accomplish this: it is the responsibility of the owner to ensure that the listed and actual configurations are the same and to notify, in writing, the BoD of any alterations at least 14 days prior to any race (notification to be received at least 14 days prior). The BoD will acknowledge by email, fax, or US mail. The rating committee will decide if the alteration will result in a rating change, and notify the owner and the hosting yacht club in time for the race. Temporarily altering the basic configuration of a boat to suit the conditions of specific races is not

ORCA Bylaws 1-15-23.doc

permitted. This includes adding/subtracting crew members to gain advantage. Configuration changes, such as a change in sail area, will result in a recalculated rating based on a boat’s current achieved rating. A skipper (the ORCA member who will be the “skipper of record”) change is considered a configuration change, and must be reported in the same manner as other alterations. 9.2.1 CONTROLLED PARAMETERS Measurable boat parameters (refer to the ORCA Measurement form for detailed parameters and measurement instructions) that ORCA keeps under configuration control for ratings purposes include the following: Length overall (LOA) Waterline length (LWL) Weight loaded for sailing, without crew and perishables Vertical height and foot of Foretriangle Height of the highest spin block if higher than top of Foretriangle Widest beam Length of ama (for trimarans) Area of sails Various mast parameters Number of crew (this “Rated Number of Crew” will be listed on the member/boat roster) APPENDIX A: Coast Guard Requirements Inland and International Navigation Rules are available on the following website: http://www. navcen. uscg. gov/mwv/navrules/rotr_online. htm
